# OT

## OT assignment repo

This repo contains Jupyter notebook files which can be imported into Jupyter notebook, as well as executable python scripts which build graphs (which may take a while to load). For convenience, I have included saved stills of the graphs which can take a long time to create.

## Problem 1

![Problem function](./problem1/problemFunction.png?raw=true "Problem function")

I defined this in the function: [problem_function](./problem1/simulatedAnnealing/simulatedAnnealing.py#L15)

It plots this graph:

![f(x)](./problem1/simulatedAnnealing/f.png?raw=true "f(x)")

Where there is a local minimum (a very shallow one on this scale) at -1 and a global minimum at 101.
